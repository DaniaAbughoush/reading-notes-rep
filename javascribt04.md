and here you need to think like computer and giving enough details.and know**vocabulary the computer under stand and 
syntax how put the word togather**
* then each step has to have a code in programming languge 

##Expretions
: there is two type of expretion :first the one which have variable using single value like variable have value of color or expretion with two value like area =5 * 6 (two valueis 5 and 6)
and thats called**operator**, java script has mathmatical operation like *-+/,
concatenation: is using strings to creat one value and there is only one string:the+symbol(example:var college= ltuc
var course=programming var your special=college+course)
 * **Functions**
 ##function 
 is a series of statment work to gother to achive taskwe can use it in script if we need to use same order,when page load it not always appear
