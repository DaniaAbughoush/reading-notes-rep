# how computer work:
* in the past th computer used to be from metal and wood then add electricity to it,but what makes computer acmpouter is this four main things:
input; data we enter , storage ,processing : Manipulating, out but: one out put could be input to other computer if they are connected, computer depend on binary system to deal with data
the smallest elements called bit which is yes or no 0 or 1 and thats the binary is asystem transfer number to 0 and 1 , and about the text it transfered like this;each letter have its number and the 
number translate to binary,images are from tiny element called pixcels tranfer it to number then to pinary,sound to vibration in wave form then to number then to binary.32 bitt can make 4 billion number
,bigger bits is the best.

* inside computer there is a multiple af circuis which make the idea comes alive by display the binary , like the and circuit,nor and there is an adder for sum, 
modren circuit mades in Micro to make electricity mve in light speed and give faster result.the cpu wher the process is make take information from the memory,different in put and output
make computer interact with the world in different field.
computer divied to two part hard ware :things you see inside like circuit,and software like programm ,codes,apps,cbu is an important it have multiplee circiuts for each command,a
and when we run multiple task on computer here come the operating system manage this task by orginzing the order.
