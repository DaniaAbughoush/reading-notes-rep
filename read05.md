# Evaluting 
####  : we call checking or testing condition evaluting, mostly for boolen data.

##### comarision operator:
* a==b if a equal b in value
* a!=b if a does not equal b in value
* a===b if a  strict equal b in value and type
* a!== if a strict not equal b in value and type
* a < b if a less than b
* a < b if a less or equal b
* a > b if a greater than b
* a ++ b if a greater or equal b

##### logical operator 
* && logical and will give true if every side is true
+ || logical or will give true if one side is true
- ! not reverse the value

### short circuit: 
:will not need to check all side like in and if one side false no need to continue or in or if one side true.

## loops:
loops check condition it is true will run the block code ,and will keep checking until it retun false.
 **There are three types of loops**
 * __for__:to tell the loop how much time should check use ccondition as counter counter.
 * __while__: will keep running till give me true condition.
 * __do while__: will run the statment inside {} at least once even its fault.

 #### loop counter ++for++ :
 has three statment after variable call it i :
 1. intilization:i=0 will act like counter
 1. condition:i<number that will run till specific number. we can name varible here instade of number 
 1. update :i++ will add one every time condition will run it also can count down --

 ###### example on writing 5times table
 first define var i=1
 and  var msg=""
 **the +=** means add  new content in the msg
 the while(i<10) to count nine time
 then add this content  in the msg+=  then i to start count number then fixed this expression *5= in '' then do math i*5 then will write the result.
