first article :
Choosing a Text Editor by The Old Coder
first the developer tell us that the selection of the best Text Editor is up to our personal preferanc and uses, and when we choose our 
Text Editor we should take this featutre in concern:the complenation of codes :which is like auto full of orders and brackets,syntax highlighting :the color of each element of 
different color.varity of themes:to give relaxetion for eyes,extentions selections whic will give us benifits
then he talked about that thereis a text editor originally come with our computer ,like Notepad but it has limited feature then ask us about the idea of the third party 
to install text editor from there original website and tell us about some options like Notepad++and ATOM and so on...
in the end he tell us the main difference between the Text Editorand IDE, Text Editor only for text editing ,manege file while the IDE is a full software backage it 
is atext editor it self,manege file,complier and debugger.

second article:The Command Line(website)
tell us that command lines or terminal will show result as text as in luminux start with user@bash:then it  start with ls then -1 for first command then will run
the first command then back to write the second command by giving us again user$bash: note that spaces is a must while writing the comman,then tell us where to find the 
text editor on our devices ,and within the terminal we have what is called "shell"which is in operating system will tell us how the terminals will behave after 
running and the most common is called bash ,to knoe which shell is used use a command called eco  user@bash: echo $SHELL .COMMAND WILL BE SAVE IN HISTORY IN Linux.

 Third artical:Basic Navigation(website)
 it is starting by teaching us some common commands on linux:
 First is: pwd which indicate tp print working directory,user@bash: pwd,second :ls :for list its more powerfull than pwd and have different usage like:if we following ls with
 nothing it will give us content of our current directory,if we following it with-1 will give us more information like file size ,name owner,when we follows ls with/etc
 we tell it not to list our current directory content but the directories contets,when we follow is with -1/etc will give us along list of directories.andthere is somthing 
 called a path whis is in command line when we refere to directory ot file,path has two types absolute or relative ,in linux there is atop directory always begin with / 
 called it root,absoulute path we can identified it easily because its begin with/ it give us the location according to root bath .relative bath give us location to where
 we are now working in the system.then telling us more about paths :like some shortcuts like :~our home directory or to refere it by ~/directory,
 (. to our current director),(..parent directory).
third command is:cd to move if we use it with nothing follow it will take us to home directory.


forth article:More About Files!(web page)
in Linux every thing is afile, you can use tab on keybord to autocomplete and keep hiting it to complete .in linux we dont need to add extensions ,linux is sensative to
Caeses; upper and small letter so be carefull and for spaces.and qoutes anything inside them will be  seperated,if we seperate using / will treat them is one item.
we dont need aspecial command to hidden directories or files jus put . full stop in the begining,and ls will not show hidden files or directories to
show them use is -a command.
